# Meeting Manager

A native macOS app that records, transcribes, and summarizes your meetings — entirely on your Mac, via Claude AI, or both.

## Download

[**Latest release**](https://github.com/ParkerRL-91/Meeting-Manager/releases/latest) — macOS 14.4+

Open the DMG, drag Meeting Manager to Applications, and launch.

### First Launch — Gatekeeper Notice

Because Meeting Manager is not yet signed with an Apple Developer ID, macOS may block it on first launch with *"Apple could not verify Meeting Manager."*

1. **Right-click** Meeting Manager in Applications and pick **Open**
2. If you still see only "Done" / "Move to Trash":
   - Click **Done**
   - System Settings → Privacy & Security → scroll to *"Meeting Manager was blocked"* → **Open Anyway**

You only do this once.

## What's New in v3.10

**Speaker identification overhaul.** Five independent signals now combine into per-cluster confidence scores so you can see at a glance which speaker labels were AI guesses vs voice-matched vs manually confirmed.

- **RSVP gate** — declined invitees no longer count as candidates
- **Confidence scores per attribution** — amber dot in the transcript when a label is genuinely uncertain
- **Adaptive voice profile learning** — manual renames weighted heavily, LLM attributions cautiously (no profile drift onto similar voices)
- **Second-pass attribution** — automatically retries unresolved clusters after transcript cleanup with the full transcript context
- **Cluster-count hint from RSVP** — diarization knows how many voices to expect, no over-segmentation when an invitee declined

**Person directory + Contacts import.** Identities are now stable UUIDs that survive name/email format changes. "dave@acme.com" and "Dave Smith" are the same Person; "Dave from Acme" is a different one.

**Cleaned + raw transcript stay in sync** — renaming a speaker updates both the segment-by-segment transcript AND the post-processed readable view immediately.

**+ everything from 3.9** (Person model, voice fingerprint anchoring, People page with inline identity management, opt-in macOS Contacts import, domain-based disambiguation, utterance sample bank for future provenance/rollback).

## Privacy

Local-first by default. Audio, transcripts, voice fingerprints, and the Person directory all stay on your Mac. Anthropic / Google / Ollama / Apple are only contacted when you explicitly enable a feature that requires them.

Full data-flow breakdown: [docs/user/privacy.md](./docs/user/privacy.md).
